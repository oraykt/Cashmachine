# DevelopX-Express Demo Challange

> https://oraykt-developx.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

First if you do not have NodeJS on your machine install via nvm.

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

Then open new terminal tab and type

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

It doesn't have private npm repo currently so we need to clone DevelopX-Express from git repo and link it locally via 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oraykt/DevelopX-Express.git && cd DevelopX-Express && npm install && npm start
```
