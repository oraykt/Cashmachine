# DevelopX-Express Demo Challange

> https://oraykt-developx.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

First if you do not have NodeJS on your machine install.

```bash
sudo apt install curl

```

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -

```

It doesn't have private npm repo currently so we need to clone DevelopX-Express from git repo and install it locally via 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oraykt/DevelopX-Express.git && cd DevelopX-Express && npm install && npm start
```
